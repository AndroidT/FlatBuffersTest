# FlatBuffs
Example app showing FlatBuffers implementation in Android

This is an example code described in blog post [FlatBuffers in Android - introdution](http://frogermcs.github.io/flatbuffers-in-android-introdution/) which shows how to use [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/). It also shows performance differences between FlatBuffers and JSON data format.

This project has been inspired by article [Improving Facebook's performance on Android with FlatBuffers](http://https://code.facebook.com/posts/872547912839369/improving-facebook-s-performance-on-android-with-flatbuffers/)
